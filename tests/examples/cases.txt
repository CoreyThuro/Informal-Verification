For any integer n, n² - n is even.

Proof:
We will prove this by considering two cases: when n is even and when n is odd.

Case 1: n is even.
If n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k.
Substituting, we get:
n² - n = (2k)² - 2k
       = 4k² - 2k
       = 2(2k² - k)

Since 2k² - k is an integer, n² - n = 2(2k² - k) is even.

Case 2: n is odd.
If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.
Substituting, we get:
n² - n = (2k + 1)² - (2k + 1)
       = 4k² + 4k + 1 - 2k - 1
       = 4k² + 2k
       = 2(2k² + k)

Since 2k² + k is an integer, n² - n = 2(2k² + k) is even.

Since n² - n is even in both cases, and any integer must be either even or odd, we conclude that for any integer n, n² - n is even.
